## **Problem Statement**
A reader wishes to engage more actively in the reading community, but is having trouble finding a centralized
hub for creating or joining online book clubs. Many book clubs are in person, scattered across various websites,
or locked behind paywalls. The user wants a place where they can search through book clubs and find ones that
fit their interests, join scheduled online meetings, and post reviews and discussions asynchronously.

## **Proposed Solution: Book Club App**

This app will serve as a centralized platform for book lovers to find, join, create, and manage book clubs,
while also offering a space for book reviews and discussions.

### **Features**
- **Centralized Book Club Directory:**
    - A searchable and filterable directory of book clubs based on genres, locations (for in-person clubs), and online-only options. Users can easily find clubs that match their interests and availability.
      Club Creation and Management:
    - Users can create new book clubs, set meeting schedules, manage members, and share club information.
    - Group admins can assign featured books for each month, and users can view previous or upcoming months.
- **Integrated Book Review System:**
    - Members can leave reviews for books theyâ€™ve read, which can be featured in the club's reading list. Reviews can include ratings, detailed comments, and discussion prompts.
 

- **Discussion:**
    - Each book club will be able to set up a meeting time with their members and meet through either a zoom/google meet link or in person if they choose. Helps for structure and building connections with other members of the group.
    - Clubs will be able to create and contribute to discussion threads, so members can share their thoughts on books asynchronously.

### **Stretch Goals**
**OpenLibraryApi:**
- This API can be utilized by giving us a ton of information about a book with just the user submitting an ISBN.
This information includes author, title, subjects, and even a thumbnail of the cover.

**Hosting:**
- We would host our app through a cloud web hosting service such as google cloud.
